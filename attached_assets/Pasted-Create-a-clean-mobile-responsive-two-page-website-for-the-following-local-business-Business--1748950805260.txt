Create a clean, mobile-responsive, two-page website for the following local business:

• Business Name: Extract from https://exampleplumbingco.com  
• Business Type: Plumbing Company  
• Location: Dallas, TX

Using the existing live site at https://exampleplumbingco.com, pull in all relevant content:
  – Main headline (H1) or business name  
  – Service descriptions  
  – Contact details (phone, address, email)  
  – Logo or brand colors if available; if no logo exists, create a text-based logo using a modern font.

**Folder/File structure:**

/
├── index.html
├── blog.html
└── posts/       # ← empty folder; blog posts will go here later

---

1. Build `index.html` (Homepage)

Structure and content:

1. **Hero Section**
   – Business name or slogan as a large H1.
   – Single call-to-action button (“Call Now” or “Get a Free Quote”) with `tel:` link.
   – Background or overlay image (use stock placeholder if none exists).

2. **About Section**
   – Short paragraph (2–3 sentences) describing the business or owner’s background (pull from existing “About Us”).
   – A bullet list “Why Choose Us” (e.g., “Licensed & Insured,” “24/7 Emergency Service,” “Over 15 Years of Experience”).

3. **Services Section**
   – List core services (e.g., “Drain Cleaning,” “Water Heater Repair”).
   – For each service, include a 1–2 sentence description, pulled from the existing site.

4. **Testimonials / Trust Signals (Optional)**
   – If current site has customer reviews or star ratings, include 1–2. If none, omit.

5. **Contact Section**
   – Address (plain text), clickable phone number `<a href="tel:…">`.
   – Simple contact form placeholder (Name, Email/Phone, Message)—styled but non-functional.

6. **Footer**
   – “© 2024 Example Plumbing Co.”
   – Simple navigation links: Home, Blog, Services, Contact.

**Design Guidelines for `index.html`:**
• Use a modern sans-serif font (e.g., Montserrat or Open Sans).  
• Light background, dark text for legibility.  
• Accent color: from the existing logo or a complementary blue (#0077CC).  
• CTA button must stand out (e.g., white text on a #0077CC background).  
• All text size ≥ 16 px on mobile.  
• Use semantic HTML5 tags (no `<font>`, `<center>`, etc.).

2. Build `blog.html` (Blog Index Page)

Structure and content:

1. **Header**  
   – `<h1>Blog</h1>`  
   – `<p>Latest tips & updates from Example Plumbing Co.</p>`

2. **Post Listing**  
   – Use `<ol style="list-style: none; padding: 0;">`.  
   – Initially include:
     ```html
     <li>No posts yet. Check back soon!</li>
     ```
   – Future posts will live in `/posts/`.

3. **Navigation**  
   – Link back to `index.html` and `blog.html`.

**Design Guidelines for `blog.html`:**
• Match header/footer colors and font from `index.html`.  
• Center content in container (`max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 20px`).  
• Example post link format for later:
  ```html
  <li>
    <a href="posts/post-2024-07-05-how-to-avoid-drain-clogs.html">How to Avoid Drain Clogs This Summer</a>
    <span style="color: #666;">(July 5, 2024)</span>
  </li>

Create /posts/ folder


Generate an empty directory named posts/.
